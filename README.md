# NEAT-mini-games
This repository allows you to observe the AI learning process. You can watch the population of sprites trying to survive and beat the game. The Python implementation of the NEAT neuroevolution algorithm ([neat-python](https://github.com/CodeReclaimers/neat-python)) was used to play the mini-games .
